# HD-Original-Encoding
Framework to run machine learning datasets with a Hyperdimensional Computing model using the original encoding on python 2.7.15

There are two main python files:

HDFunctions.py contains all the functions needed to run a hyperdimensional computing model and an HDModel class

main.py contains an example of utilizing the functions in HDFunctions.py to train and test a HD model on the isolet dataset
main.py also contains comments to help desribe how to use your own dataset with our tool.

Please let us know if you face any problems or discover any bugs.

If you utilize this software, please cite our paper:
