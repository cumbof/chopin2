#### Originally forked from [https://github.com/moimani/HD-Permutaion](https://github.com/moimani/HD-Permutaion)

This repository includes some utilities to build a Hyperdimensional Computing classification model according to the architecture
originally introduced in [https://doi.org/10.1109/DAC.2018.8465708](https://doi.org/10.1109/DAC.2018.8465708)

It also includes a script able to correctly format the BRCA, KIRP, and THCA DNA-Methylation data from the paper 
[Classification of Large DNA Methylation Datasets for Identifying Cancer Drivers](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bdr.2018.02.005) by Fabrizio Celli, Fabio Cumbo, and Emanuel Weitschek.

The original datasets are available available at [ftp://bioinformatics.iasi.cnr.it/public/bigbiocl_dna-meth_data/](ftp://bioinformatics.iasi.cnr.it/public/bigbiocl_dna-meth_data/)
